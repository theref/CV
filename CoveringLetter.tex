\opening{Dear Mr Millet,}

Re: Industrial Placement

I wish to apply for the role of Risk Analyst that you spoke about at Cardiff University and have attached my CV accordingly.

As a Maths student I have a keen interest in the finance sector and my degree has provided me with the perfect skills for the position.
In particular, it involved a great deal of problem solving skills combined with understanding complex and highly technical topics.

\closing{Yours Faithfully,}
