Re: Trade Analyst

I wish to apply for the role of Junior Trader within your firm, ready to begin after I graduate from Cardiff University this summer.

The role interests me due its challenges, I am looking for a job that will push me and force me to continually learn and improve.
Optiver is also a very modern trading firm which, combined with the large potential for travel, makes it an ideal match for myself.

As a Maths student, my degree has provided me with the perfect skills for this position; I am highly numerical and analytical.
I have also repeatedly demonstrated my ability to quickly comprehend new, challenging subjects during the several research placements I have undertaken.
These placements, as well as my Final Year Project, have given me fantastic time management and communication skills and shown how well I can work when under pressure.

Thank you for taking the time to look at my application, I look forward to hearing from you in the future.

\closing{Yours Faithfully,}
