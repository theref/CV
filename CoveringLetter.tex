\opening{Dear Mr Millet,}

Re: Industrial Placement

I wish to apply for the role of Risk Analyst that you spoke about at Cardiff University and have attached my CV accordingly.

As a Maths student my degree has provided me with the perfect skills for this position.
In particular, it involved a great deal of problem solving skills combined with understanding complex and technical topics.
Doing a summer research placement has also shown that I am very self-motivated and able to communicate effectivley when working as part of a team.

I am a quick learner with keen interest in the financial sector and I would be very grateful for the opportunity to start my career with Lloyds. Thank you for taking the time to look at my applicaton, I look forward to hearing from you in the future.

\closing{Yours Faithfully,}
