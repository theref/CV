%   PERSONAL PROFILE
%----------------------
\section{Personal Profile}
I am an undergraduate mathematics student currently seeking a post graduate position in applied mathematics.
I have undertaken mathematical research throughout my undergraduate career, mainly focusing on the area of Game Theory, with a small contribution made to the area of Alternating Sign Matrices.
I have also spent a year working at one of the UK's largest Insurance companies applying my analytical skills within an industrial environment.
\\

Since my first undergraduate year, I have been awarded a mathematics scholarship and prize, invited to present my work at an international conference and twice been selected from 160 of my peers to undertake a research internship during the summer break.

\section{Programming Skills}
I am proficient in most aspects of computing:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Operating Systems: Windows, MacOS, Linux (server and client);
    \item General software: Excel, Word Processing (\LaTeX, Microsoft Word, Libre office), Presentation (Beamer, Microsoft Powerpoint);
    \item Programming: Python, Django, Ruby, Git, Trac and well evidenced ability to gain proficiency in new languages quickly.
    \item Supercomputing: Experience using Cardif University's supercomputer \url{http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing} RAVEN and submitting jobs using PBS.
\end{itemize}

%	INTERESTS AND ACTIVITIES
%-----------------------------
\section{Achievments and Interests}
I have been involved in Scouting from the age of 8, playing a leading role in the organisation both as member and a leader.
Recently, I was appointed a group-wide, adult leader position which will allow me to continue the work I have been doing whenever I am home from University.
I will be leading a group of 30 scouts on an international expedition in Norway in summer 2017.\\
\\
I have played Rugby Union from the age of 5, reaching county standard and playing for the Welsh Exiles before injury forced my retirement.
This gave me a lot of experience of working within a team, both as a captain and a member. \\
\\
At University, I took up the sport of ultimate frisbee. I have been promoted to the first team, represented my university at several tournaments (including varsity) and was elected to serve as treasurer for the previous academic year. \\
\\
In my spare time I relax by playing the piano, having achieved Grade 5 some years ago. I hold a full, clean UK driving licence.
