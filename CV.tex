%TODO - edit this section before sending it
\section{Personal Profile}
I am an undergraduate mathematics student on course to obtain a First Class Degree with honours, currently seeking a post graduate position in applied mathematics.
I have undertaken mathematical research throughout my undergraduate career, mainly focusing on the area of Game Theory, with a small contribution made to the area of Alternating Sign Matrices.
I also spent a year working at one of the UK's largest Insurance companies applying my analytical skills within an industrial environment.
\\
Since my first undergraduate year, I have been awarded a mathematics scholarship, presented my work at an international conference and twice been selected from 160 of my peers to undertake a research internship during the summer break.

\section{Work Experience, Research and Publications}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
%------------------------------------------------
\textsc{Sept. 2016 - } & Final Year Project, "Fingerprinting Prisoners Dilemma Strategies"\\
\textsc{May 2017} & \footnotesize{Reproduced research to differentiate between different strategies in Prisoners Dilemma using fingerprinting. Those tools where added to the open source library Axelrod-Python, and then used to analyse all of the strategies within the library. The second half of the project will be to develop novel ways to categorise and identify strategies. This improved my software development skills and also allowed to me to undertake a large amount of independent research with some guidance from my supervisor.}

%	INTERESTS AND ACTIVITIES
%-----------------------------
\section{Achievements and Interests}
I have been involved in Scouting from the age of 8, playing a leading role in the organisation both as member and a leader.
Recently, I was appointed a group-wide, adult leader position which will allow me to continue the work I have been doing whenever I am home from University.
I will be leading a group of 30 scouts on an international expedition in Norway in summer 2017.\\
\\
I have played Rugby Union from the age of 5, reaching county standard and playing for the Welsh Exiles before injury forced my retirement.
This gave me a lot of experience of working within a team, both as a captain and a member. \\
\\
At University, I took up the sport of Ultimate Frisbee. I have been promoted to the first team, represented my university at several national tournaments (including varsity) and was elected to serve as treasurer during my second year. \\
\\
In my spare time I relax by playing the piano, having achieved Grade 5 some years ago. I hold a full, clean UK driving licence.
