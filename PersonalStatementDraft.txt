I am a driven undergraduate student with a proven record for performing well in an independent research environment.
I have undertaken two summer research internships with Dr Vince Knight at Cardiff University.
In both of these I displayed the ability to learn and understand new complex topics quickly.
I have also demonstrated advanced software development skills and have written pieces of open-source software to advance computational abilities in the areas of Game Theory and Alternating Sign Matrices.

I would like to pursue a Phd in Maths at Cardiff university in order to further develop my mathematical ability and also because I am interested in a career in academia.
I have thoroughly enjoyed the time I spent doing independent research, both during the summer internships and also for my final year project.
I have also spent two years tutoring first year undergraduates in a beginner Python course. I found that I enjoyed the teaching more than I expected and I hope to be able to continue this as a Phd students and further on too.

I believe I am a good Phd candidate because I have already demonstrated the ability to perform well in a research environment.
I understand that self discipline and time management is incredibly important and have been developing these attributes for several years.
